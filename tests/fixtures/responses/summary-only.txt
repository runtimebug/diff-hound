This PR introduces several improvements to the codebase. The Calculator class now supports an initial value and multiplication. However, there are a few concerns:

1. Input validation is missing in several places
2. Error handling could be improved
3. There's an unused variable that should be removed

Overall, the changes are well-structured but need some defensive programming additions.
